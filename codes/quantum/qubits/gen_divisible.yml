name: 'Generalized divisible codes'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1709.08658}'

description: |
  Given a vector of even integers \(\vec{w}\),
  a code is called generalized divisible if the inner product of \(\vec{w}\) with any codeword is divisible by a fixed integer.
  
  Given a CSS code of distance \(d\) and divisor \(2^\nu\) where the transversal \(X\) is a nontrivial logical operator,
  one can construct a CSS code with distance \(d\) and divisor \(2^{\nu+1}\)\cite{arXiv:1709.08658}.
  The code has parameters \([[O(d^{\nu}),\Omega(d),d]]\).
  This forms a tower of generalized divisible quantum codes.

  Although it is valid to think of this procedure\cite{arXiv:1709.08658} as mapping binary matrices with a 
  certain divisibilty to larger binary matrices with a higher divisibilty,
  the construction is based on converting two magic state distillation protocols 
  based on Clifford measurements to those based on codes with transversal T-gates.

    The method of Haah\cite{arXiv:1709.08658} constructs a code with divisor \(2^{\nu}\) 
    that admits a transversal gate at the \(\nu\)-th level of the Clifford hierarchy.
