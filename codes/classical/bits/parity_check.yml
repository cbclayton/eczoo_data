code_id: parity_check
physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'Parity-check code'

description: 'An \([n,k,d]\) parity-check code is a binary linear code that finds errors by computing the parity of linear combinations of bits. A given parity-check code is defined by the particular set of linear combinations it uses.'

protection: 'Protection varies among parity-check codes. Depending on its construction, a given parity-check code may be able to correct errors or it may only be able to detect errors.'

features:
  encoders:
    - 'Compute the parity of each linear combination of bits and include them in the code vector as \emph{parity bits}. The details vary by code.'

  decoders:
    - 'Compute the parities and compare against the parity bits. If the parity information of a codeword disagrees with its corresponding parity bit, then an error has occured. At this point, correction may or may not be possible.'

notes:
  - 'The number of parity bits is n-k.'
